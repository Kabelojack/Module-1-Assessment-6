            Soft leather uppers makes this traditional court shoe a real pleasure to wear, either for a game of pick-up or hanging out afterward.

            And thanks to the high-abrasion rubber outsole, this shoe will last through everyday wear and tear, while absorbing shock when you're shooting three-pointers.</p>
